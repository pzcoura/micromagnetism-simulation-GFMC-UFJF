# micromagnetism-simulation-GFMC-UFJF
The program was developed in Fortran 90 and was optimized for single-CPU execution by using only one-dimensional arrays (vectors). It can be compiled using the gfortran (11.4) compiler (with optimization flags -O2 or -O3) or the NVIDIA (24.3) Fortran 90 compiler. It employs micromagnetic techniques to calculate the interactions.
