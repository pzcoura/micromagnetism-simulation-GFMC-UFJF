# micromagnetism-simulation-GFMC-UFJF
## Description

	The program was developed in Fortran 90 by the Física da Matéria Condensada
  (UFJF – Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora, Brazil - https://www2.ufjf.br/ppgfisica/) 
  and was optimized for single-CPU execution by using only one-dimensional arrays (vectors), 
  which significantly improves performance. It can be compiled using the gfortran (11.4) 
  compiler (with optimization flags -O2 or -O3) or the NVIDIA (24.3) Fortran 90 compiler. 
  It employs micromagnetic techniques to calculate interactions such as:

        • Heisenberg exchange.
        • Magnetocrystalline anisotropy.
        • Dipolar interactions (in discrete form).
        • Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI) of three distinct types — interfacial DMI, Bloch-type (bulk),
          and D₂d symmetry.
        • Zeeman interaction.

 	It allows the definition of various geometries, including nanowires (both flat and curved, defined via functions),
  cylindrical structures, and helical surfaces. Additionally, regions with distinct magnetic properties (magnetic impurities)
  can be defined within the host material, with shapes such as rectangular, circular, or ring-like domains.

    The program supports several initial configurations of magnetic moments, including various types of skyrmions 
  (defined in the input file), domain walls (head-to-head and tail-to-tail), antiferromagnetic (AFM) skyrmions,
  and vortex/antivortex states.

	The Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert (LLG) equations are integrated using three numerical schemes:

        • Adams–Bashforth method (explicit, without corrector).
        • Adams–Moulton method (implicit, with corrector).
        • fourth-order Runge–Kutta method.

  It is also possible to apply spin-polarized current densities, including both spin-transfer torque (STT), and spin–orbit 
  torque (SOT) mechanisms. The code uses a simplified version of the Micromagnetic Finite Element Method (FEM), where the 
  volume elements are defined as parallelepipeds whose dimensions can vary from point to point — that is, each element may 
  have distinct edge lengths depending on its position in space.

  The resulting magnetization configurations and their dynamic evolution can be visualized using Xmakemol or Ovito, 
  which support the `.xyz` and related output formats generated by the code. Other visualization programs compatible with 
  this file extension may also be used.

### Output files
      
  The following files are generated as outputs of the program. Each one contains specific information that helps to analyze
  or visualize the magnetic system and its time evolution.
    
        • 'comp_mag_xyz.dat' 
        
             Stores the average magnitude of the magnetic moments over time. 
             It is used for checking whether the magnetization remains stable during the simulation.
             
        • 'abertura'
        
             Writes the geometric defect angle of the nanostrip. This angle defines the curvature or opening of the sample.
             
        • 'config.xyz' 
        
             Contains the magnetization components (Mx, My, Mz) of each cell at each time step. 
             This file can be opened in Ovito or Xmakemol to visualize the magnetization dynamics.
             
        • 'energia.dat'
        
             Records the total and individual contributions to the magnetic energy:

            1. Total energy
            2. Dipolar energy
            3. Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI) energy
            4. Exchange energy
            5. Magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy

        • 'posicao_energia_dw.dat' 
        
              Same as energia.dat, but also includes the position of the skyrmion or domain wall center along the nanowire:
        
            - ξ-coordinate: position along the wire (longitudinal axis)
            - δ-coordinate: position perpendicular to ξ (transverse direction)
            
        • 'posicao_energia_plano_dw.dat' 
        
              Similar to posicao_energia_dw.dat, but corresponds to a flat nanowire (without any geometric defect). 
              It is useful for comparing the effect of curvature on energy and position.
        
        • 'normal.xyz' 
        
              Contains the normal components of the magnetic moments. 
              It is used to verify whether the magnetization aligns correctly along the local normal direction.
        
        • 'tangente.xyz' 
        
             Contains the tangential components of the magnetic moments. 
             It is used to verify whether the magnetization behaves as expected along the tangential direction.
	   

	
  Each line of this file corresponds to a physical or numerical parameter, and optional flags can be used to enable or disable 
  specific interactions or currents. Each line in 'dados_input' contains a comment describing the corresponding quantity and its units.

## Validation

    The code has been validated through standard micromagnetic benchmark tests and has been employed in peer-reviewed studies 
    addressing skyrmion dynamics and curvature effects in nanomagnetic systems. A detailed description of the numerical 
    implementation and validation will be provided in a forthcoming paper submitted to 
    Chinese Physics B (https://doi.org/10.1088/1674-1056/ae1727).
